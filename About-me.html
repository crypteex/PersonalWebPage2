            <h5>My <span>Journey</span></h5>

            <p>
              Currently, studying at the ADA University in the faculty of<br />
              Information Technologies.<br />
              I got 1310 from SAT and 6.5 from IELTS.<br />
              Likewise, I am the President of the "ADA Blockchain" club.
              Moreover, I had been selected to receive a merit scholarship from
              the University of South Florida. Instead of academical
              achievements,<br />
              I run my family-business online. I am the clothing-designer of the
              brand. <br />
              We have created a multi-branding concept store for serving
              customers with quality clothes for kids.<br />
              I have been managing 12 mates with passion.<br />
              First and foremost, our team's main goal is the satisfaction of
              the customers and the conclusion of all the work done comes
              together at this point<br />
